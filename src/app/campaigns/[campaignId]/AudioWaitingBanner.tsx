// is only watched (a table of AI players, say) hears none of the narration
// that arrives. useNarrationAudio keeps every such passage and plays the
// newest at the first gesture (the older ones keep their replay buttons, so
// an hour of watching does not play back as ten minutes of stale scenes);
// until then the only sign used to be a struck-through icon in the header,
// which a watcher never noticed. This
// banner sits above the composer, on screen in every layout, and stays until
// the gesture it asks for: there is nothing to dismiss, because any click on
// the page (this button included) is the fix.
