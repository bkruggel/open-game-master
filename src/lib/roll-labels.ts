// How a roll is worded wherever it is stored or shown: the detail the engine
// writes, the chronicle card, cinematic mode's toast and chronicle line. An
// attack or damage roll records its attacker, who goes in front, and its
// detail says what was used and against whom, so each creature is named
// once. Every other roll, and one stored before the attacker was recorded,
// keeps the sheet it concerns (characterId) in front, as it always has.
// Pure (type imports only), so client components and test scripts import it.
// The kind words are the dictionaries' (rollmap.kind.*); the surface that
// shows them passes its translator.
